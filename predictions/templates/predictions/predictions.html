        <h3>Predictions</h3>
        <p class="notice">
            Predictions are based off of a univaritae Poisson Distributon model. They do not take into account injuries, suspensions,
            or team motivation (time of season, upcoming matches, etc.). These prediction results should not be used for the purpose of
            sports betting as they do not take into account many other factors that could affect the outcome of the match.
