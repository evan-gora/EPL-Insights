        <h3>Predictions</h3>
        <p class="notice">
            Predictions are based off of a univarite Poisson Distributon model created on all 50,568 matches. 
            They do not take into account the current form of the teams, injuries, suspensions, or team motivation (time of season, upcoming matches, etc.). 
            These prediction results should not be used for the purpose of sports betting as they do not take into account many other factors that could affect the outcome of the match.
        </p>
        <p class="credit">
            The code for the Poisson Distribution was taken and modified to fit my use case from David Sheehan. The original article can be found
