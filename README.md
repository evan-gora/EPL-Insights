##EPL Insights

EPL Insights is a web application written using DJango and Bootstrap which allows users to view match data, view season stats,
and view and save match predictions.The data for EPL Insights was gathered using the Premier League web scraper I also made, which
has been imported into a database. Users can filter the data by season, team, or stadium, as well as having the ability to view
information based on each team.
